# Machiavelli
I read Machiavelli *”The Prince”* many years ago and it influences my opinions over some issues. 
Since the book is not at my hand right now, I do not recall what exactly I read. Before I wirte my own
understanding, I will temporarily use the script of [TheSchoolOfLife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTQlnmWCPgA&list=PLwxNMb28XmpeuwUhM0OT338_T5XTtJJok&index=2)

His thought pivots around a central, uncomfortable observation: that the “wicked” tend to win; and 
they do so because they have a huge advantage over the “good”: they are willing to act with the 
darkest ingenuity and cunning to further their cause. 

They are not held back by those rigid opponents of change: principles. 

To be as nice as one wished, but never to be overly devoted to acting nicely, and indeed to know how 
to borrow, when need be, every single trick employed by the most cynical, dastardly, unscrupulous, and nasties people who have ever lived.

A guide about what nice people should learn from tyrants.
